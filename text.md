What didn't we see there?

# Paragraph
According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of going somewhere, but only 36% plan to spend a vacation in their native country. Like, what haven't we seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea of the south, the dense forests of the Sayan Mountains and the harsh ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions on your account, a passport and many hours of flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova — a brave young mother who took three children in her arms, sat them in her Lada and drove 20 thousand kilometers across her native country. We have selected and described some interesting places worthy of your vacation.

# Curonian spit
Here, in the middle of forests and sand dunes, you can see two water horizons — the calm Curonian Lagoon on one side and the rippling waves of the Baltic Sea on the other. A unique natural area on the edge of the Russian enclave.

The Kaliningrad Region does not end there. For the traveler
and the researcher is there in the same neighborhood — the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit — and the German heritage of placers of small seaside towns. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the hustle and bustle, plunging into the tranquility of nature
and the smell of the steel, cool sea.

# Kola
Almost the entire peninsula is located beyond the Arctic Circle. The Sami tundra,
from which to the south is the taiga, and to the north is the Arctic Ocean, pretending to be the Barents Sea.

Perhaps you have watched Zvyagintsev and even heard the story of the Arctic festival
in Teriberka. Perhaps the word "Khibiny" did not remain under the snow of school memories of geography lessons. Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating the earth's crust, and apathy has been covering you for a long time. But your dream of seeing the Northern lights begins to come true with a ticket to Murmansk.

# Altai
Altai is one of the most beautiful places
in Russia. First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees, mountain rivers and lakes.
And if you open the windows in the car, you can get acquainted with the invisible miracle of these places — mountain air.

The climate in Altai is temperate, so it's best to go here in summer. So you will see all the diversity of the local flora and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are also inhabitants of the Altai Territory.

# Winter Baikal
Everyone knows Baikal as the largest lake in the world. Many also know that this is the largest source of fresh water and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.

Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for skioring competitions. This is a kind of sport when a skier ties himself to a motorcycle,
and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record of 197.011 km/h was set at the Baikal Mile Festival.

# Karelia
Siberia does not end in the Urals,
but in Karelia: Siberian larch, which forms the taiga, does not grow west of the Water Lake. But here she is waving
at 30 meters — the forests of Karelian national parks have never known an axe because of impassable swamps. Some pines are more than half a millennium old. Touch a living being who saw the sun before Ivan the Terrible saw it. In the virgin forest, you will not find a trail for a hundred kilometers.
And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from the ground are marked with bear claws. So that everyone knows who is the boss here.
